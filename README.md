# Node Server from Scratch

Today, we'll code an HTTP server from scratch, without using a framework. Typically, we'd use a framework (like Express) for writing a server application but today we'll write a very basic server application from scratch. This process will likely feel cumbersome and painful to scale upwards, but it will help us develop an appreciation for the work Express that will spare us from having to do.

## Set Up
