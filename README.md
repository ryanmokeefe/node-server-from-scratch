# Node Server from Scratch

Today, we'll code an HTTP server from scratch, without using a framework. Typically, we'd use Express for writing a server application but today we'll write a very basic server application from scratch to build the basis of an appreciation for what Express will do for us (it will save us tons of typing).

## Set Up

```sh
 $ git clone git@git.generalassemb.ly:ga-wdi-exercises/node-server-from-scratch.git
 $ cd node-server-from-scratch
```

> Solution code available on `solution` branch...
